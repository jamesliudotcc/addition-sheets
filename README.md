# Math Worksheet generator

This project is for math worksheets that benefit from pencil and paper, starting with long addition. Thus, the CSS is focused at delivering a good print experience.

It is slightly regretable that it uses React instead of simpler web technologies, but it is what I and the LLMs know. There are also many repeatable HTML elements, and I am not about to learn web components to do this. That and the deployment has to be with Github Pages for now.

The idea is to extend it so that more problem types are available, and some configuration of the level of difficulty. For example:

- Problems are set up or not
- How many digits
- Multiplication with conventional setup or lattice

It's mostly vibe coded. I try to keep some reigns on this, but at some point, this is so small that I expect model improvements to overtake tech debt. Plus, the GH Pages architecture gives me quite a large margin of safety.
