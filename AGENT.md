## Tooling

This project uses bun as a replacement for much JavaScript tooling. Thus:

- Do not use vite
- Do not use yarn
- Do not use npm
- Do not use npx

This project uses biome for linting, imports ordering, and formatting.

- Do not use eslint
- Do not use prettier

This project uses tsgo instead of tsc.

## Philosophy

Use semantic HTML instead of Aria tags whenever possible. This project is for evergreen browsers and evergreen accessiblity tools.
